### Switch Instances

Users can change the terminal for a specific instance by using the Switch  
Instances tab. This tab contains links to switch the instance, where each   
link shows the host name of the instance.

Switching the instance changes the terminal view and now user can see all
the command executed with command output for selected instance with the 
host name at the top of the terminal.

### Drag and Drop to Report

Terminal view provides a drag and drop mechanism where user can drag the 
command's output and drop into the report input box. System is intelligent 
enough to take the command as the key for user report and dropped ouptut as 
the value for the report. Adding the command's output to the report for one
instance automatically adds the same for all other insatances too.
